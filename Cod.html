        I can go on and give you a list of step backs but you’d honestly have to experience it for yourself. To tolerate this game alone the weapons must be balanced. If not, it’s a piece of trash.

        The issue with call of duty these days is the fact they do not listen. Weapon balancing I’m sure you heard of the M4, 725, Grau good times… no one wants a TTK time of 0.03 seconds. That’s why you play hardcore. Matter a fact you may as well play hardcore free for all. It’s just bad. If they can get that 1 thing right, then there’s hope. But it seems to not get through them these past 3 years.

        Absolute garbage, the graphics are horrible, I’m 99% sure that not a single employee of sledgehammer has ever opened a history book related to ww2, recycled animations from mw2019 ( can clearly see a glock in some of the cut scenes), the absolute dogshit of a zombies map with nothing to achieve except boredom after round 5, if you could even call them rounds, the story mode will have anyone with any kind of knowledge of ww2 asking yourself if you’re higher than snoop dog at one of his concerts, recycled maps from world at war….

        Quite possibly the worst video game ever released. I feel like Activision stole $60 from the majority of players and would like nothing more to see them struggle financially after this release to the point where they can't recover. Seriously though either save your money or buy Battlefield instead.

        Pros: Frees up 60 GB of space once uninstalled.

We had a ton of fun exploring the brand new map, brand new characters, and brand new story mode. If you haven't played the prequel, don't fret, you'll still enjoy the game. The story does a great job getting you caught up in everything that happened.</i></div>
