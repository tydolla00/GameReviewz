        I am optimistic for this game. I think Pokémon needs a refresh after 25 years of the same formula, and Pokémon Legends Arceus seems to deliver while still remaining relatively faithful to the franchise. The overworld is basically a giant wild area, and I think that ride Pokémon will definitely make traveling the world pretty swift. Battle system looks okay. Same old, same old, but with some twists based on stats. My only major concern remaining is that the frame rate and models are not the best, but it's at least a step up from Sword and Shield.

        It still... doesn't look that great, tbh. At least they've seemingly hammered out the performance issues. Looks aren't everything, though. I've all but given up on Pokemon so if this one turns out to be a good, open, well-rated RPG I may give it a try. I don't have my hopes up, but I hope I'm impressed.

        Frankly I'm totally fine if it's not open world

        An open-world Pokemon game done well would be mindblowingly good but I've seen enough open-world games fall completely flat that making open areas is a much safer bet and for the Pokemon Company I would honestly rather see them take the safer bet and make something good
